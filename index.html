                <ul>
                    <li>Technology has always peaked my interest growing up and ever since then i've been pursuing a job in a field that requires any kind of technical knowledge. Whether that is: IT,Web Development, Digital marketing, etc... I got interested in web developing about a year ago and have been self-teaching for about six months. I recently decided that I want to take this further and deepen my knowledge so that I can find a job in the tech industry that i've wanted for so long.</li>
                    <li>My other Passions are content creation and video editing. I make sports content of me and a group of friends competing in basketball around the state at different parks. I'm always trying to get new content because I do all the editing and its fun for me.</li>
